# Agentic-Reasoning-Master

This is the merged repository for the Agentic-Reasoning project.
## Merge Information

This repository was created by merging three separate `Agentic-Reasoning` project directories, as outlined in the master merge plan (`docs/master_merge_plan.md`). The following source directories were merged:

*   `/Users/vetleforthun/Documents/GitHub/Agentic-Reasoning` (Presumed stable version)
*   `/Users/vetleforthun/Documents/Agentic-Reasoning`
*   `/Users/vetleforthun/Documents/GitHub/agenticgroking/Agentic-Reasoning`

The merge was performed by first copying the contents of the presumed stable version into the new `Agentic-Reasoning-Master` directory. Then, separate branches (`merge-from-documents` and `merge-from-agenticgroking`) were created to merge the other two directories. Finally, these branches were merged into the `main` branch.

Specific file handling:

*   **`backend/repo_map.py`:** The version from the stable branch was used as the base. Changes from the `merge-from-agenticgroking` branch were then incorporated, primarily consisting of adding a type hint to the `get_function_signature` method.
*   **`backend/server.py`:** The version from the stable branch was used as the base. The `/generate_code` endpoint from the `merge-from-agenticgroking` branch was added, along with necessary imports and initializations for `dspy` and `CoderAgent`.
*   **`backend/utils.py`:** The version from the stable branch was used.
*  **`.gitignore`:** Modified during the merge, with untracked files addressed by the user.
*  **`README.md`:** Updated to include this merge information.
