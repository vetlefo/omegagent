# Gemini Integration for Codebase Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for integrating Google's Gemini with our Agentic-Reasoning system, specifically leveraging Gemini's large context window (up to 2 million tokens) as the initial phase of our STORM orchestration process.

## Strategic Value

### 1. Holistic Codebase Understanding

Gemini's ability to process up to 2 million tokens enables:
- Loading the entire codebase in a single context window
- Understanding global relationships between components
- Identifying architectural patterns across the system
- Creating comprehensive "big picture" analysis

### 2. Efficient Agent Orchestration

As the initial step in our STORM process, Gemini will:
- Guide more specialized agents to relevant sections of code
- Provide context and background that narrow-context agents lack
- Reduce redundant exploration by specialists
- Act as a "map maker" for the codebase territory

### 3. Technical Advantage

This approach gives us a significant advantage:
- GPT-based agents are limited to ~128K tokens
- Claude-based agents are limited to ~200K tokens
- Gemini can process ~2M tokens - a 10-15x improvement
- Enables processing of large repositories without chunking

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Codebase Ingestion Service (Priority: MUST HAVE, Size: L)

#### Tasks
1. Create a service to process and prepare the codebase for Gemini
2. Implement intelligent file filtering (exclude binaries, large data files, etc.)
3. Add support for token counting and budget management
4. Build a caching layer for repeated analyses
5. Create a repository crawler that can work with local and remote repos

**Example Implementation:**
```python
class CodebaseIngestionService:
    def __init__(self, repo_path: str, config: Config):
        self.repo_path = repo_path
        self.config = config
        self.token_counter = TokenCounter()
        self.cache = IngestionCache(config.cache_ttl)
        
    async def process_repository(self) -> CodebaseContext:
        """Process an entire repository for ingestion by Gemini."""
        # Check cache first
        cache_key = self._generate_cache_key()
        cached_context = self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached_context:
            return cached_context
            
        # Process repository
        repo_files = self._gather_relevant_files()
        filtered_files = self._apply_filters(repo_files)
        
        # Check token budget
        total_tokens = sum(self.token_counter.count_file(f) for f in filtered_files)
        if total_tokens > self.config.max_token_budget:
            # Apply progressive file truncation to fit within budget
            filtered_files = self._apply_token_budget(filtered_files, self.config.max_token_budget)
            
        # Build context
        context = CodebaseContext()
        for file in filtered_files:
            context.add_file(file.path, file.content, file.token_count)
            
        # Cache result
        self.cache.set(cache_key, context)
        return context
```

### 2. Gemini Analysis Module (Priority: MUST HAVE, Size: L)

#### Tasks
1. Implement Gemini API client with proper authentication
2. Create text-based prompts for holistic codebase analysis
3. Build structured output parser for Gemini responses
4. Add retry and fallback mechanisms for API failures
5. Implement progressive analysis for very large codebases

**Example Implementation:**
```python
class GeminiCodeAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, config: Config):
        self.gemini_client = GeminiClient(api_key)
        self.config = config
        
    async def analyze_codebase(self, context: CodebaseContext) -> CodebaseAnalysis:
        """Perform comprehensive analysis of the codebase using Gemini."""
        prompt = self._build_analysis_prompt(context)
        
        try:
            response = await self.gemini_client.generate_content(
                prompt, 
                model=self.config.gemini_model,
                temperature=0.2  # Low temperature for analytical tasks
            )
            
            # Parse structured response
            analysis = self._parse_structured_response(response)
            
            # Validate analysis completeness
            if not self._is_analysis_complete(analysis):
                # Request supplementary analysis for missing aspects
                supplementary = await self._request_supplementary_analysis(context, analysis)
                analysis = self._merge_analyses(analysis, supplementary)
                
            return analysis
            
        except GeminiAPIError as e:
            # Handle API errors with fallback
            logging.error(f"Gemini API error: {e}")
            if self.config.enable_fallback:
                return await self._fallback_analysis(context)
            raise
```

### 3. STORM Integration (Priority: MUST HAVE, Size: M)

#### Tasks
1. Modify StormOrchestratorAgent to use Gemini as first agent
2. Create interface between Gemini analysis and other agents
3. Build knowledge sharing protocols between agents
4. Implement guided context provision for specialized agents
5. Add metrics to measure Gemini's effectiveness in the workflow

**Example Implementation:**
```python
class StormOrchestratorAgent:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.config = config
        self.gemini_analyzer = GeminiCodeAnalyzer(config.gemini_api_key, config)
        self.specialist_agents = self._initialize_specialist_agents()
        
    async def orchestrate(self, repo_path: str, user_query: str) -> Response:
        """Orchestrate the multi-agent storm process starting with Gemini."""
        # Step 1: Gemini whole-codebase analysis
        ingestion_service = CodebaseIngestionService(repo_path, self.config)
        codebase_context = await ingestion_service.process_repository()
        
        # Step 2: Get holistic analysis from Gemini
        analysis = await self.gemini_analyzer.analyze_codebase(codebase_context)
        
        # Step 3: Generate subqueries and context for specialist agents
        subqueries = self._generate_subqueries(user_query, analysis)
        
        # Step 4: Dispatch specialist agents with targeted context
        specialist_responses = []
        for subquery in subqueries:
            context = self._extract_relevant_context(analysis, subquery)
            agent = self._select_appropriate_agent(subquery)
            response = await agent.process(subquery, context)
            specialist_responses.append(response)
            
        # Step 5: Synthesize final response
        return self._synthesize_response(user_query, specialist_responses, analysis)
```

### 4. Evaluation Framework (Priority: SHOULD HAVE, Size: M)

#### Tasks
1. Build benchmarking suite for Gemini vs. other approaches
2. Implement metrics for analysis quality and completeness
3. Create comparison visualizations for decision making
4. Add performance monitoring and optimization tools
5. Build A/B testing framework for different orchestration patterns

## Benefits to Users

1. **More Accurate Results**: With the entire codebase available for analysis, results will be more accurate and contextually aware.

2. **Faster Responses**: Specialist agents can be directed immediately to relevant areas rather than searching.

3. **Deeper Insights**: Global patterns and relationships can be discovered that might be missed with a fragmented approach.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces redundant processing and optimizes the use of more expensive specialized models.

## Implementation Considerations

### API Costs and Limits
- Gemini API has different pricing than OpenAI/Anthropic
- Budget management for large codebases is essential
- Consider implementing cost optimization strategies

### Performance Optimization
- Pre-filtering irrelevant files before sending to Gemini
- Implementing an LRU cache for repository analysis
- Using incremental analysis for repositories with minimal changes

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Handle scenarios where Gemini API is unavailable
- Provide graceful degradation to chunked analysis with other models
- Cache previous analyses to reduce API dependency

## Success Criteria

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Gemini should identify at least 90% of key architectural components and relationships.

2. **Guidance Accuracy**: Specialist agents directed by Gemini analysis should start with the right context at least 85% of the time.

3. **Performance Improvement**: End-to-end response time for complex queries should decrease by at least 30% compared to approaches without Gemini.

4. **User Satisfaction**: User ratings for answer quality should show measurable improvement after Gemini integration.

## Timeline and Integration with Roadmap

This Gemini integration should be implemented as part of Phase 2 (Architecture - Component Refactoring), specifically alongside the CoStormRunner refactoring process, as it fundamentally changes the orchestration approach.

Implementation should begin after the foundational state management and configuration systems are in place (Phase 1), to ensure proper infrastructure for the integration.
