Documentation Setup Details & Checklists

1. Project Overview
README.md:
Project title, brief description, and objectives.
Links to detailed documents in subfolders.
Project_Vision_Goals.md:
Vision statement, long-term goals, and potential commercial applications.
Success metrics and expected impact.
Architecture_Overview.pdf:
High-level system diagram with components (Orchestrator, Agents, Television, Graph DB, etc.).
Data flow, integration points, and scalability strategy.
Stakeholder_Expectations.md:
Benefits for developers and enterprises.
Value proposition and market positioning.
2. Phase 1: Backend Integration Checklist
 Clone and merge AI Codepilot and Agentic Reasoning codebases.
 Set up environment (virtualenv, Conda) with all required dependencies.
 Integrate the Encoder module into repository mapping.
 Implement CollaborativeStorm logic in OrchestratorAgent.
 Develop unit tests for all new modules.
 Create data flow diagrams to illustrate agent interactions.
 Validate end-to-end processing with sample prompts.
 Document challenges and initial fixes.
3. Phase 2: Visualization with Television Checklist
 Define a schema for event messages (fields, types, etc.).
 Instrument agents to emit events at key steps.
 Set up an event bus (in-memory or Redis) for asynchronous communication.
 Develop a minimal Television UI (e.g., using React) to display real-time logs.
 Test connectivity between backend and UI (WebSocket connection).
 Refine UI to include timeline or tree visualizations.
 Gather user feedback and iterate on UI design.
 Document integration steps and UI component details.
4. Phase 3: Cloud Deployment Checklist
 Write Dockerfiles for each service (backend, Television UI, event broker).
 Test Docker Compose locally for service interoperability.
 Create Kubernetes manifests or a Helm chart for deployments.
 Set up Ingress with TLS for secure external access.
 Provision infrastructure using Terraform (cluster, load balancers, etc.).
 Deploy to a staging environment and verify service functionality.
 Configure auto-scaling and monitor performance metrics.
 Document deployment procedures and troubleshooting tips.
5. Phase 4: Knowledge Integration Checklist
 Deploy Memgraph (or chosen graph database) in your cloud environment.
 Create a detailed schema for code entities, relationships, and documents.
 Develop ingestion scripts to parse the codebase and populate the graph.
 Implement retrieval functions for both graph and vector searches.
 Integrate retrieval results into agent prompts.
 Test knowledge-augmented generation on sample queries.
 Document the graph schema, retrieval API, and ingestion workflow.
6. Phase 5: Security & Performance Optimization Checklist
 Conduct security audits: vulnerability scans, penetration testing, RBAC verification.
 Implement API authentication, rate limiting, and TLS for all endpoints.
 Set up a logging and monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).
 Run load and stress tests; record results.
 Optimize code and service configurations based on performance data.
 Finalize user documentation and troubleshooting guides.
 Update release notes and change logs.
7. Appendices & Miscellaneous
Glossary.md: Keep definitions updated as you introduce new concepts.
FAQ.md: Document common questions encountered during development/testing.
Release_Notes.md & Change_Log.md: Version history and key updates for future reference.
Troubleshooting_Guide.md: Include common error messages, debugging steps, and contact info for further support.
Additional Recommendations

Version Control:
Use Git with a clear branching strategy (e.g., feature branches for each phase, then merge into a main branch after testing).
Documentation Standards:
Use Markdown for most documents for easy readability and Git integration.
Use diagrams (created in tools like draw.io or Lucidchart) to visually represent architecture and data flows.
Ensure each document has a header with the document title, version, date, and author for clarity.
Regular Updates:
As the project evolves, update checklists, diagrams, and guides. Set aside time during each phase for documentation reviews.
Collaboration Tools:
Even if you’re solo, consider using a tool like Notion or a project management board (Trello, Jira) to track progress against these checklists.
