1. Intelligent Context Retrieval
Relevance Scoring:
File Indexing: Before sending any context to the LLM, index your project files with metadata (file names, types, tags, and a brief summary).
Vector Embeddings: Use vector databases (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Memgraph’s vector features) to compute embeddings for each file or code snippet. When a request is made, compute the embedding of the query and perform a nearest-neighbor search to retrieve only the top‑K most similar files.
Graph-Based Filtering:
Leverage your knowledge graph (GraphRAG) to understand relationships (dependencies, file interconnections). This can help you decide which files are directly related to the current task, eliminating irrelevant parts of the project.
2. Context Summarization
Summarize Long Files:
For large files or modules, create summarized versions (using techniques like chunking and summarization models) that capture the essential information.
You can periodically generate summaries (or “TL;DR” sections) for each file and store them, so when a query comes in, you provide the summary instead of the full file.
Hierarchical Summaries:
Use a multi‑tiered context: a high‑level summary (overall architecture, main components) plus detailed context only for the files most likely to be relevant.
This “context pyramid” ensures that you include essential context without overwhelming the LLM with too much detail.
3. Dynamic Context Window Management
Sliding Window Approach:
Instead of including an entire file or entire history, use a sliding window that only considers the most recent and relevant chunks of text.
Implement logic that discards older, less relevant context or compresses it into a summary that fits within the window limits.
Prompt Engineering:
Structure your prompt to clearly demarcate context sections. For example, label parts as “Relevant Context:” and “Additional Details:” so the model understands which portions are critical.
Include only what’s needed for the specific task—ask the system to retrieve context for a particular function or feature, not the entire codebase.
Iterative Retrieval:
Use an iterative process where the LLM first generates an initial answer with minimal context, then, if necessary, asks for more details. This way, the system “pulls in” only the extra context required for clarity.
4. Tooling and Automation
Automated Context Manager:
Build a module in your OrchestratorAgent that automatically determines which files or code sections to include based on the query’s keywords, project metadata, and past interactions.
This context manager should interface with your vector/graph search components to dynamically fetch the top‑relevant snippets.
Caching Strategies:
Cache frequent queries and their corresponding context slices. If the same or similar query comes in later, you can quickly load the cached, optimized context without reprocessing the entire codebase.
Feedback Loop:
Incorporate feedback on the LLM’s responses to refine which context pieces are most helpful. Over time, this learning mechanism can further optimize your context selection process.
Implementation Example
Imagine you receive a prompt to “Improve the login validation function.” Your system would:

Query the Vector Store:
Compute an embedding for “login validation” and retrieve the top‑3 files or snippets related to login processes.
Graph Query:
Check the knowledge graph for dependencies connected to authentication and session management.
Summarize & Aggregate:
If one of the files is huge, use its stored summary instead.
Construct a prompt that might look like:
Relevant Context:
- File: auth.py (Summary: Contains functions for login, logout, and session validation)
- File: user_model.py (Contains user schema and validation rules)
Additional Details: [if needed, include a short snippet from a critical section]

Task: Improve the login validation function by adding error handling and logging.
Iterative Querying:
If the initial answer is vague, the system can automatically fetch a bit more detail from the specific section identified.
Why It’s a Gamechanger
By keeping your context windows tight and relevant:

Efficiency: You avoid overwhelming the LLM, which means faster, more accurate responses.
Clarity: Only the pertinent parts of your project are exposed, reducing noise and potential hallucinations.
Scalability: As your project grows, this dynamic approach ensures your system remains performant without manual intervention.
Implementing these strategies is the key to making your integrated system both powerful and manageable, and it really is the gamebreaker you need.
