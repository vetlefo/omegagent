# CoderAgent Integration and Refactoring

## Overview
This document details the integration of `CoderAgent` with `BingSearch` and `KnowledgeBase` tools from Agentic Reasoning, along with its refactoring for modularity and maintainability.

## Transformations

### 1. Tool Integration
- **Change**: Added `BingSearchTool` and `KnowledgeBaseTool` from `runner.py` to `CoderAgent`.
- **Why**: Enhances code generation with external research and structured knowledge, improving accuracy and context-awareness.
- **How**: Initialized tools in `__init__` and used them in `generate_code` via `_search_relevant_info` and `_retrieve_knowledge`.

### 2. Code Modularization
- **Change**: Split `generate_code` into smaller methods (`_search_relevant_info`, `_retrieve_knowledge`, `_build_enhanced_prompt`).
- **Why**: Improves readability, testability, and reusability; each method has a single responsibility.
- **How**: Extracted tool logic into separate methods, maintaining original functionality while clarifying the workflow.

### 3. Type Safety
- **Change**: Used type hints and added `pydantic` dependency.
- **Why**: Ensures robust input/output validation, aligning with `RunnerArgument` and `TurnPolicySpec` usage in Agentic Reasoning.
- **How**: Added type annotations and included `pydantic` in `requirements.txt`.

## Benefits
- **Readability**: Clear method names and separation of concerns.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update or replace individual components (e.g., swapping BingSearch for another tool).
- **Performance**: No significant overhead; tool calls are optimized for top-k results.

## Preserved Behavior
- Original code generation functionality remains intact, now augmented with external tools for richer outputs.
