# Integration Guard Rails: Agentic Reasoning & AI Codepilot

This document outlines the integration path and provides a guard railing summary for merging the Agentic Reasoning and AI Codepilot projects.

## Clear Path to Integration

Yes, there is a clear and logical path to integrate these two projects, leveraging the strengths of each to enhance the other. The integration primarily focuses on incorporating the advanced AI reasoning and research capabilities of "Agentic Reasoning" into the practical coding assistant framework of "AI Codepilot".

**Key Integration Areas:**

1.  **Backend Integration:**
    *   Incorporate Agentic Reasoning's core modules (Encoder, CollaborativeStorm, StormAnalysis utilities) into AI Codepilot's backend.
    *   Enhance the OrchestratorAgent with Agentic Reasoning's orchestration logic.
    *   Utilize the Encoder for improved repository mapping and semantic code search.
    *   Apply Collaborative Storm principles to the CoderAgent and MergeAgent.

2.  **Frontend Enhancement (Future Phase):**
    *   Extend the AI Codepilot frontend to visualize and interact with advanced reasoning processes.
    *   Integrate knowledge base visualizations and reasoning step displays.
